* simple-mpc [[http://melpa.org/#/simple-mpc][file:http://melpa.org/packages/simple-mpc-badge.svg]]
A GNU Emacs major mode that acts as a front end to [[http://www.musicpd.org/clients/mpc/][mpc]].
[[./screenshot.png]]
** Requirements
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs >=24]]
- [[http://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]] or [[https://www.mopidy.com/][Mopidy]]
- [[http://www.musicpd.org/clients/mpc/][mpc]]
** Installation
*** MELPA
The easiest way to install is through [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]].

To do this add MELPA to your =package-archives= list if you have not
yet done so:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'package) ;; You might already have this line
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize) ;; You might already have this line
#+END_SRC

Then install the package through either =M-x list-packages= or by just
running =M-x package-install simple-mpc=.
*** Manual
- Clone the repository
- Add it to your emacs init:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/simple-mpc")
(require 'simple-mpc)
#+END_SRC
** Usage
*** Quickstart
Start with =M-x simple-mpc=. The rest of the keybindings now appear in
a buffer. Configuration can be done with =M-x customize-group <RET>
simple-mpc=. Viewing the current playlist and querying the database is
done with =c= and =s= respectively. Most commands (like
=simple-mpc-query-add= and =simple-mpc-delete=) respect the region.
*** Structure
Simple-mpc consists of three 'views', two of which have their own
minor mode that implements specific extra functionality:

|------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------|
| view             | major mode      | minor mode                       |
|------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------|
| main             | simple-mpc-mode | /                                |
| query            | simple-mpc-mode | simple-mpc-query-mode            |
| current playlist | simple-mpc-mode | simple-mpc-current-playlist-mode |
|------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------|

simple-mpc-mode is always active and contains the most common
bindings. Additional functionality is added with minor modes. Someone
who does not like the interface can use =simple-mpc-query-mode= and
=simple-mpc-current-playlist-mode= directly.
*** Bindings
Bindings can be viewed with =describe-mode= (=C-h m=) but are listed
below for completeness:
**** simple-mpc-mode
|-----+-------------------------------------|
| key | function                            |
|-----+-------------------------------------|
| =t= | simple-mpc-toggle                   |
| =n= | simple-mpc-next                     |
| =p= | simple-mpc-prev                     |
| =f= | simple-mpc-seek-forward             |
| =b= | simple-mpc-seek-backward            |
| =c= | simple-mpc-view-current-playlist    |
| =C= | simple-mpc-clear-current-playlist   |
| =S= | simple-mpc-shuffle-current-playlist |
| =l= | simple-mpc-load-playlist            |
| =s= | simple-mpc-query                    |
| =q= | simple-mpc-quit                     |
|-----+-------------------------------------|
**** simple-mpc-query-mode
|--------------+-------------------------------|
| key          | function                      |
|--------------+-------------------------------|
| =q=          | simple-mpc-query-quit         |
| =S=          | simple-mpc-query-sort         |
| =<return>=   | simple-mpc-query-add          |
| =<S-return>= | simple-mpc-query-add-and-play |
|--------------+-------------------------------|
**** simple-mpc-current-playlist-mode
|------------+----------------------------------|
| key        | function                         |
|------------+----------------------------------|
| =d=        | simple-mpc-delete                |
| =q=        | simple-mpc-current-playlist-quit |
| =<return>= | simple-mpc-play-current-line     |
|------------+----------------------------------|
*** Hook
You can use a hook like this to ensure that mpd is running when you
open simple-mpc:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'simple-mpc-mode-hook (lambda () (my/mpd-start)))

    (defun my/mpd-start ()
      "Start MPD if it's not already running and check, then update the MPD database."
      (interactive)
      (if (= 0 (call-process "sh" nil nil nil "-c" "pgrep mpd"))
          (message "MPD was already running.")
        (shell-command "mpd")
        (my/update-database)
        (message "MPD started.")))

    (defun my/mpd-kill ()
      "Kill MPD."
      (interactive)
      (call-process "killall" nil nil nil "mpd")
      (message "MPD killed."))

    (defun my/mpd-update ()
      "Updates the MPD database synchronously."
      (interactive)
      (call-process "mpc" nil nil nil "update")
      (message "MPD database updated."))
  #+end_src
** Configuration
Configuring simple-mpc can be done entirely through the =simple-mpc=
customization group (=M-x customize-group simple-mpc<RET>=).

When using Mopidy as a server setting =simple-mpc-playlist-format= is
recommended, the default output from =mpc search= won't be very
descriptive otherwise. The following configuration works well mopidy
(note that the whitespace between the metadata delimiters and the
separator itself are TAB characters (=C-q <TAB>=), *not spaces*):

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(custom-set-variables
...
 '(simple-mpc-playlist-format "%artist%	%album%	%title%	%file%")
 '(simple-mpc-table-separator "	")
...)
#+END_SRC
** History
This mode was inspired by [[https://github.com/pft/mingus][mingus]] written by Niels Giesen and parts of
the interface were inspired by [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] written by Dirk-Jan C. Binnema. I
used mingus for > 4 years and was mostly happy with it, but
occasionally there were bugs and interface choices that I disagreed
with. After looking through the source code in an attempt to fix these
issues I came to the conclusion that it would be better to implement
my own mode. A big reason for this decision was the fact that mingus
uses its own MPD library implementation called [[https://github.com/pft/mingus/blob/master/libmpdee.el][libmpdee.el]], which I
expect contain some obscure bugs. I think it is a better choice to
instead take advantage of mpc, a small program that is maintained by
MPD developers and implements more than libmpdee.el. On top of that it
makes the major mode much smaller and easier to maintain. Currently
simple-mpc consists of ~300 LOC versus ~5000 LOC for mingus (mingus
does have more features though).

GNU Emacs also contains [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/mpc.el][mpc.el]] written by Stefan Monnier. It's
interesting but wasn't really what I was looking for, partly because
of its interface (inspired by [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox][Rhythmbox]]), and partly because it's not
particularly well documented.
** Todo
- add a way to combine multiple search terms e.g. mpc search artist a album b
