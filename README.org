* simple-mpc [[http://melpa.org/#/simple-mpc][file:http://melpa.org/packages/simple-mpc-badge.svg]]
A GNU Emacs major mode that acts as a front end to [[http://www.musicpd.org/clients/mpc/][mpc]].
[[./screenshot.png]]
** Requirements
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs 24]]
- [[http://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]]
- [[http://www.musicpd.org/clients/mpc/][mpc]]
** Installation
*** MELPA
The easiest way to install would probably be through [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]].

To do this add MELPA to your =package-archives= list if you have not
yet done so:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'package) ;; You might already have this line
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize) ;; You might already have this line
#+END_SRC

Then install the package through either =list-packages= or by just
running =M-x package-install simple-mpc=.
*** Manual
- Clone the repository
- Add it to your emacs init:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/simple-mpc")
(require 'simple-mpc)
#+END_SRC
** Usage
*** Quickstart
Start by executing =M-x simple-mpc=. The rest of the keybindings now
appear in a buffer. Configuration can be done with =M-x
customize-group <RET> simple-mpc=.
*** Structure
Simple-mpc consists of three 'views', two of which have their own
minor mode that implements specific extra functionality:

|------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------|
| view             | major mode      | minor mode                       |
|------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------|
| main             | simple-mpc-mode | /                                |
| query            | simple-mpc-mode | simple-mpc-query-mode            |
| current playlist | simple-mpc-mode | simple-mpc-current-playlist-mode |
|------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------|

simple-mpc-mode is always active and contains the most common
bindings. Additional functionality is added with minor modes. Someone
who does not like the interface can use =simple-mpc-query-mode= and
=simple-mpc-current-playlist-mode= directly.
*** Bindings
Bindings can be viewed with =describe-mode= (=C-h m=) but are listed
below for completeness:
**** simple-mpc-mode
|-----+-----------------------------------|
| key | function                          |
|-----+-----------------------------------|
| =t= | simple-mpc-toggle                 |
| =n= | simple-mpc-next                   |
| =p= | simple-mpc-prev                   |
| =f= | simple-mpc-seek-forward           |
| =b= | simple-mpc-seek-backward          |
| =c= | simple-mpc-view-current-playlist  |
| =C= | simple-mpc-clear-current-playlist |
| =l= | simple-mpc-load-playlist          |
| =s= | simple-mpc-query                  |
| =q= | simple-mpc-quit                   |
|-----+-----------------------------------|
**** simple-mpc-query-mode
|--------------+-------------------------------|
| key          | function                      |
|--------------+-------------------------------|
| =q=          | simple-mpc-query-quit         |
| =S=          | simple-mpc-query-sort         |
| =<return>=   | simple-mpc-query-add          |
| =<S-return>= | simple-mpc-query-add-and-play |
|--------------+-------------------------------|
**** simple-mpc-current-playlist-mode
|------------+----------------------------------|
| key        | function                         |
|------------+----------------------------------|
| =d=        | simple-mpc-delete                |
| =q=        | simple-mpc-current-playlist-quit |
| =<return>= | simple-mpc-play-current-line     |
|------------+----------------------------------|
** History
This mode was inspired by [[https://github.com/pft/mingus][mingus]] written by Niels Giesen and parts of
the interface were inspired by [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] written by Dirk-Jan C. Binnema. I
used mingus for > 4 years and was mostly happy with it, but
occasionally there were bugs and interface choices that I disagreed
with. After looking through the source code in an attempt to fix these
issues I came to the conclusion that it would be better to implement
my own mode. A big reason for this decision was the fact that mingus
uses its own MPD library implementation called [[https://github.com/pft/mingus/blob/master/libmpdee.el][libmpdee.el]], which I
expect contain some obscure bugs. I think it is a better choice to
instead take advantage of mpc, a small program that is maintained by
MPD developers and implements more than libmpdee.el. On top of that it
makes the major mode much smaller and easier to maintain. Currently
simple-mpc consists of ~300 LOC versus ~5000 LOC for mingus (mingus
does have more features though).

GNU Emacs also contains [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/mpc.el][mpc.el]] written by Stefan Monnier. It's
interesting but wasn't really what I was looking for, partly because
of its interface (inspired by [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox][Rhythmbox]]), and partly because it's not
particularly well documented.
